### 1. Revenue Growth and Peak Performance
- **2020 was the strongest year**, with sales consistently growing each quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Q4 2020 saw the highest revenue** ($1.25M in December 2020), making it the best-performing period.
- **January & February 2021 ($540k)** also maintained strong sales, though a we see a sharp downward trend start.

### 2. Declining Trend in 2021
- A sales anomaly and significant decline occurred at the start of 2021 with **January ($289K), February ($248K)** which whilst stronger than previous Q1's to date, is still a sharp downturn from previous months.
- The Q1 revenue decline suggests a major downturn, likely caused by external market conditions, reduced consumer demand, or internal operational shifts.

### 3. Quarterly Insights & Seasonal Trends
- **Q3 and Q4 of each year** typically show strong performance, likely due to seasonal shopping trends and marketing efforts.
- **September & October** typically follow the same pattern of a quick jump in sales in September, followed by a sharp fall in October which suggests a macro economic trend or seasonal 'lull' in the lead up to black friday sales.

### 4. Key Takeaways & Recommendations
- **Investigate the causes** of the 2021 decline (e.g., market changes, competition, internal factors).
- **Leverage high-performing periods** (e.g., Q3 and Q4 of strong years) to refine marketing and sales strategies.
- **Reassess business strategy for the remaining of 2021 and 2022**, focusing on pricing, promotions, and customer engagement to regain momentum especially for historically weaker months.
